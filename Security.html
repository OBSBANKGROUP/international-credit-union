        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>
          At International Credit Union, we are committed to protecting the
          privacy, confidentiality, and security of your personal information
          and maintaining your trust in our banking, financial, and digital
          services. We collect personal data including, but not limited to, your
          full name, date of birth, identification details, contact information,
          financial records, transaction history, credit information, employment
          details, device and technical data, usage information, communication
          records, and any other information necessary to provide our services.
          This information may be collected directly from you through account
          applications, transactions, communications, website and mobile app
          usage, or indirectly from credit bureaus, regulatory authorities,
          identity verification services, employers, or authorized third
          parties. We use your personal data to open and manage accounts,
          process transactions, provide loans and investment services, verify
          your identity, comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money
          laundering regulations, assess creditworthiness, prevent fraud, manage
          risk, improve our services, respond to inquiries, send service-related
          communications, and, where permitted by law, provide marketing and
          promotional materials, which you may opt out of at any time. We
          process your information based on contractual necessity, legal
          obligations, legitimate business interests, and, where required, your
          consent. We do not sell your personal information; however, we may
          share it with trusted service providers, payment processors, IT
          vendors, auditors, credit reporting agencies, regulators, law
          enforcement authorities, courts, and other entities when required by
          law or in connection with mergers, acquisitions, or corporate
          restructuring, and all such parties are required to maintain
          appropriate confidentiality and security standards.
        </p>

        <p>
          We implement comprehensive administrative, technical, and physical
          safeguards including encryption, secure servers, multi-factor
          authentication, access controls, monitoring systems, and regular
          security audits to protect your data, though no system can guarantee
          absolute security, and customers are encouraged to protect their
          credentials and notify us of suspicious activity. We retain personal
          information only for as long as necessary to fulfill contractual and
          legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and meet
          regulatory retention requirements. Where data is transferred
          internationally, we ensure appropriate safeguards are implemented in
          accordance with applicable data protection laws. Subject to local
          regulations, you may have the right to access, correct, update,
          restrict, object to, or request deletion of your personal information,
          withdraw consent where processing is based on consent, request data
          portability, or lodge a complaint with a relevant supervisory
          authority. Our website and mobile applications use cookies and similar
          technologies to enhance user experience, improve performance, analyze
          usage patterns, strengthen security, and deliver relevant content, and
          you may manage cookie preferences through your browser settings. Our
          services are not intended for minors unless permitted by applicable
          law, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children
          without proper authorization. This Privacy Policy may be updated
          periodically to reflect legal, regulatory, or operational changes, and
          any updates will be published with a revised effective date.

        <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>

        <div class="terms-box">
          <p>
            These Terms and Conditions govern your access to and use of the
            products, services, websites, mobile applications, accounts,
            financial tools, and any related services provided by International
            Credit Union and by opening an account, accessing our digital
            platforms, or using any of our Services, you agree to be legally
            bound by these Terms as well as all applicable laws and regulations.
            You agree to provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date information
            when establishing or maintaining any account and to promptly notify
            us of any changes to your personal or financial information; you are
            responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
            credentials, including passwords, PINs, security codes, and devices,
            and you accept full responsibility for all activities conducted
            under your account unless unauthorized access is reported in a
            timely manner.
          </p>

          <p>
            We reserve the right to verify your identity, conduct credit
            assessments, and perform compliance checks in accordance with
            applicable laws including anti-money laundering and
            counter-terrorism financing regulations. You agree to use our
            Services solely for lawful purposes and not to engage in fraudulent,
            abusive, unauthorized, or illegal activities, including attempts to
            interfere with system security, gain unauthorized access, or misuse
            financial products.
          </p>

          <p>
            All transactions are subject to verification and acceptance by us,
            and we may refuse, delay, block, or reverse transactions where
            permitted by law or where we suspect fraud, illegality, or breach of
            these Terms. Fees, charges, interest rates, and service costs
            applicable to your accounts or services will be disclosed in
            relevant product agreements or fee schedules and may be updated from
            time to time with appropriate notice as required by law; continued
            use of the Services after such notice constitutes acceptance of the
            revised terms. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any Service,
            feature, or product at our discretion, subject to regulatory
            requirements, and we may amend these Terms periodically, with
            updated versions published through our official channels.
          </p>

          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim liability for
            indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising
            from your use of the Services, including but not limited to losses
            caused by system interruptions, technical failures, cyberattacks, t
            hird-party service disruptions, delays in processing, or
            circumstances beyond our reasonable control, although nothing in
            these Terms excludes liability where such exclusion is prohibited by
            law. You acknowledge that financial markets involve risk and that
            investments, loans, and other financial products may fluctuate in
            value, and you accept responsibility for understanding the risks
            associated with any product before participation. We may rely on
            third-party service providers and partners to deliver certain
            aspects of our Services, and while we select providers carefully, we
            are not responsible for the independent actions of such third
            parties except as required by law.

            reproduce, distribute, modify, reverse engineer, or exploit such
            materials without prior written consent.

          <p>
            These Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with
            the laws of the applicable jurisdiction in which your account is
            held, and any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive
            jurisdiction of the competent courts or dispute resolution bodies in
            that jurisdiction unless otherwise required by consumer protection
            laws. If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or
            unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force
            and effect
          </p>

            time subject to fulfillment of outstanding obligations, and we
            reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts where there is
            breach of these Terms, suspected fraud, legal requirement, or
            prolonged inactivity.
